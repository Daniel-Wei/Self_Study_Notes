### 003 Cloud Computing Introduction

#### 1. What is Cloud Computing
- Cloud Computing is the **on-demand delivery** of computer power, database storage, applications and other IT resources.
- Through a cloud services platform with **pay-as-you-go** pricing
- You can **provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources** you need
- You can access as many resources as you need, **almost instantly**
- Simple way to access servers, storage, databases and a set of application services
- Amazon Web Services owns and maintains the network-connecter hardware required for these application services, while you provision and use what you need via a web application

#### 2.The Deployment Models of the Cloud
- **Private Cloud**
  - Rackspace
  - Cloud services used by a single org, not exposed to the public
  - Complete control
  - Security for sensitive applications
  - Meet specific business needs

-** Public Cloud**
  - Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, AWS
  - Cloud resources owned and operated by a 3rd party cloud service delivered over the internet

- **Hybrid Cloud**
  - Keep some servers on premises and extend some capabilities to the Cloud
  - Control over sensitive assets in your private infrastructure
  - Flexibility and cost-effectiveness of the public cloud

#### 3. The Five Characteristics of Cloud Computing
- **On-Demand Self Service**
  - Users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service provider

- **Broad Network Access**
  - Resources available over the network, and can be accessed by diverse client platforms

- **Multi-tenancy (多重租赁) and Resource Pooling (资源共用共享):**
  - Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy
  - Multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resources

- **Rapid Elasticity (弹性) and Scalability**
  - Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when needed
  - Quickly and easily scale based on demand

- **Measured Service**
  - Usage is measured, users pay correctly for what they have used

#### 4. Six Advantages of Cloud Computing
- **Trade Capital Expense (CAPEX) for Operational Expense (OPEX)**
  - Pay On-Demand: do NOT own hardware
  - Reduced Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) & Operational Expense (OPEX)
 
- **Benefits from massive economies of scale**
  - Prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to large scale
 
- **Stop guessing capacity**
  - Scale based on actual measured usage

- **Increase speed and agility (灵活性)**

- **Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers**

- **Go global in minutes**: leverage (借用) the AWS global infrastructure

#### 5. Problems solved by the Cloud
- **Flexibility**: change resource types when needed
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Pay as you go, for what you use
- **Scalability**: accommodate larger loads by making hardwar stronger or adding additional nodes
- **Elasticity**: ability to scale out and scale in when needed
- **High-availabiliy and Fault-tolerance**: build across data centers
- **Agility**: rapidly develop, test and launch software applications
