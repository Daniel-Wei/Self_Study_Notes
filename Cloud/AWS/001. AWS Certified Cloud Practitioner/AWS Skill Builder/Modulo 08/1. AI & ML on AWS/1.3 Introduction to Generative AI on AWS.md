### 1.3 Introduction to Generative AI on AWS.md

#### 1. Deep Learning
- Subset of ML
- Models are trained using layers of artificial neurons that mimic the human brain
- Each layer of these neural networks summarizes and feeds information to the next layer until a final model is produced

#### 2. Generative AI
- A type of DL powered by extremely larga ML models known as foundation models (FMs)
- FMs are pre-trained on vast collections of data
- While traditional ML models are trained to perform singular tasks, FMs can be adapted to perform multiple tasks
- Larga Language Models(LLMs): a popular type of FM trained to use human languages

#### 3. Generative AI on AWS
- Amazon SegaMaker JumpStart
  - An ML hub with FMs and pre-built ML solutions deployable with a few clicks
 
- Amazon Bedrock
  - A fully managed service for adapting and deploying FMs from Amazon and other leading AI compaines
 
- Amazon Q
  - An interactive AI assistant that can be integrated with a company's information repos
