#### Architecture Diagram
- Deliver customer data for analysis and ML model training

- E-commerce app
  - Uses an ML model to make product recommendations to customers

- Store app data
  - An Amazon DynamoDB DB stores the historcial customer data gathered through the app
  - This makes sense for low-latency reads and writes but not ideal for ML model training

- Ingest data
  - Kinesis Data Streams ingests the data from DynamoDB
  - Amazon Data Firehose then aggregates the data
 
- Process data
  - The data is in JSON format
  - So Firehose invokes an AWS Lambda function that transforms the data into .csv format
 
- Deliver data
  - Firehose then delivers the data to the company Amazon S3 data lake
  - Where it is available for multiple consumers
 
- Catalog data
  - AWS Glue Data Catalog servces as a metadata repo with tables
  - Describe the schema and location of the Amazon S3 data
 
- Perform data analysis
  - Data scientists use Athena to gather insights through queries
 
- Train model
  - SegaMaker AI reads the same dataset directly from S3
  - ML engineers can then train new versions of the recommendation model using the latest information
