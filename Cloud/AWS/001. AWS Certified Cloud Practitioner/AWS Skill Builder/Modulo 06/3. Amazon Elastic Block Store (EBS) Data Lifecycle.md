### 3. Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) Data Lifecycle

#### 1. EBS Snapshots
- Point-in-time backups of EBS volume
- Usage
  - Disaster recovery
  - Data Migration
  - Volume resizing
  - Create consistent backups of production workloads
- Incremental, so they only save blocks on the volume that have changed after your most recent snapshots
- Can be used to create multiple new volumes
- New volumes created from a snapshot are an exact copy of the original volume at the time the snapshot was taken
- Snapshits of EBS volumes are stored redundantly in multiple AZs using Amazon S3
