### 3.1 Amazon Elastic File System

#### 1. Definitions
- A fully managed, scalable file storage service for use with AWS cloud services and on-premises resources
- It operates using the Linux Network File System (NFS) protocol, and automatically scales to petabytes as you add/remove files without distrupting applications
- EFS can be accessed by multiple EC2 instances simultaneously

#### 2. Benefits
- Multi-AZ Redundancy
  - Automatically replicates data across multiple AZs in a Region for high availability
  - This built-in redundancy protects against AZ failures and provides continuous access to your file systems
 
- Shared Access
  - Multiple EC2 instances can access the same file syetsm simultaneously
  - This shared access model makes EFS ideal for collaborative workloads and distributed applications
 
- Elastic Storage
  - Automatically grows and shrinks as you add/remove files, with no need to provision or manage storage capacity
  - Cost-effetive for varying workload demands
 
#### 3. Amazon EFS Storage Classes
- Standard Storage Classes
  - EFS Standard and EFS Standard-Infrequent Access (Standard-IA) Storage Classes offer Multi-AZ resilience and the highest level of durability and availability
  - They have a higher cost associated with them due to higher availability and durability
 
#### 4. Amazon EFS Data Lifecycle
- Further optimized Amazon EFS storage costs by automatically moving data between storage classes based on usage patterns

- Transition to IA
  - Cost-optimized for data that is accessed a few times each quarter
  - By default, files that are not accessed in Standard storage for 30 days are transitioned to IA
 
- Transition to Archive
  - Cost-optimized for data that is accessed only a few times each year or less
  - By default, files that are not accessed in Standard storage in 90 days are transitioned to Archive storage

- Transition to Standard
  - By default, files are not moved back to Standard storage, and they remain in the IA or Archive storage class when they are accessed
