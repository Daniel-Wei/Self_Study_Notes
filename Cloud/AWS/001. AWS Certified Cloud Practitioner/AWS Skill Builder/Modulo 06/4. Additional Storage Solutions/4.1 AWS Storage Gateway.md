### 4.1 AWS Storage Gateway

#### 1. Definitions
- Hybrid cloud storage service that make it possible to seamlessly intergrate on-premised environments with AWS Cloud storage
- You can use it to extend your local storage to the cloud while maintaining low-latency access to frequently used data

#### 2. Benefits
- Seamless Integration
  - Storage Gateway enables smooth connectivity between on-premises applications and AWS Cloud storage
  - Preserve existing workflows and minimizing distruptions

- Improved Data Management
  - Provides centralized management of hybrid storage environments, enhancing accessibility, security and compliance
 
- Local Caching
  - Locally keeps frequently accessed data for quick access while managing less-used data in the cloud
 
- Cost Optimization
  - Reduces on-premised storage costs by using cloud storage for data archiving, backup and disaster recovery purposes
 
#### 3. Types
- Amazon S3 File Gateway
  - Provides on-premises applications with access to virtually unlimited cloud storage through familiar file protocols
  - Make it possible to store and retrieve cloud objects using familar file operations
  - When you deploy an S3 File Gateway, it appears to your local systems as a standard file server
  - Files written to this server are automatically uploaded to Amazon S3 while maintaining local access to recently used data through intelligent caching
  - Your applications can continue working with files as they always have while the actual data is securely stored in the AWS Cloud
 
- Volume Gateway
  - You create virtual storage volumes while maintaining local access to your data
  - It essentially functions as a bridge between your on-premises infrastructure and AWS Cloud storage by representing your local data as iSCSI volumes that can be mounted by existing applications
  - Operares in 2 main configurations
    - Cached Volume Mode: Stores primary data in the cloud while frequently accessed data is cached locally for low-latency access
    - Stored Volume Mode: Locally keeps your complete dataset while asynchronously backing it up tp the cloud as EBS snapshots
   
- Tape Gateway
  - Makes it possible to replace physical tape infrastructure with virtual tape capabilities while benefiting from the durabikity and scalability of AWS Cloud storage
  - Provides an interface that works with existing tape backup software, making the transitiin from physical tapes to cloud storage seamlessly.
  - When you deploy a Tape Gateway, it represents itself to your backup applications as standard tape hardware
  - Your backup software writes data to these virtual tapes, just as it would do physical tapes and stored in Amazon S3
  - You can also configure Tape Gateway to automatiaclly transition less frequently accessed data to a more cost-effective storeage class for long-term retention.
