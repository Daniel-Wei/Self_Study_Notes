### 2.1 Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)

#### 1. Definition
- Fully managed, highly-available object storage service for storing and retrieving any amount of data as objects
- It offers 99.9% durability, meaning your data is higjly protected against loss
- Offers feature like versioning, lifecycle management, and various classed to optimize costs

#### 2. S3 Objects

- When you upload a file to Amazon S3, it becomes an object and is stored durably across multiple facilities within your chosen Region
- Each object typically includes the data itself, metadata, and a unique identifier, or key
- Objects ban be of any file type, or application data, and size can be various
- Each object is uniquely identified within a bucket by its key, which is essentially its file name
- Objects can also have properties like version ID, access control information, and user-defined metadata

#### 3. S3 Buckets
- A container for storing objects in Amazon S3
- Have a globally unique name across all of AWS, which helps to identify and organize your stored data

- Buckets servce as the basic unit for access control and can hold a virtually unlimited number of objects
- A crucial role in data management by making it possible to group related objects and apply policies at the bucket level

- When creating a bucket, you specify its name and the Region where it will reside
- Buckets can be configured with various settings, including versioning, logging and access permissions

#### 4. Benefits
- Virtually Unlimited Storage - Cost Effective
- Object Lifecycle Management
  - Amazon S3 lifecycle policies automatically move objects between storage classes based on your defined tules, optimizing costs over time
  - You can set up automatic transitions and expirations to manage data throughout its entire lifecycle
- Broad range of use cases
  - Supports both cloud-based applications and tranditional on-premises workloads
  - Content contribution
  - Hosting static websites
  - Delivering media files
  - Application data storage, archiving, data lakes, and compliance-driven data retention
 
#### 5. Security and Privacy Management
- By default, everything in S3 is private
- Must explicitly grant permissions to access these resources

- Bucket Policies
  - Resource-based policies that can only be attached to S3 buckets
  - Specifies which actions are allowed or denied on the bucket, in addition to every object in that bucket
 
- Identity-based Policies
  - Permissions that control what action users, groups, or roles can perform on S3 resources are configured using identity-based policies
  - These policies attach directly to identities rather than to the S3 resources themselves
  - You can use these policies to specify which S3 buckets and objects users can access and what actions they can perform

- Encryption
  - Encryption at rest: secures data stored in S3 buckets, preventing unauthorized access to stored objects
  - Encryption in transit: safeguards data travelling to and from Amazon S3, maintaining secure communication bwteeen clients and the service
