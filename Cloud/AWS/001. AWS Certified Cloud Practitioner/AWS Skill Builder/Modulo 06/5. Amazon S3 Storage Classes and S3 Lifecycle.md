### 5. Amazon S3 Storage Classes and S3 Lifecycle.md

#### 1. Amazon S3 Storage Classes and Use Cases
- S3 Standard
  - General-purpose storage
  - When you upload a obj to Amazon S3 without specifying a storage class, the obj is added to S3 standard by default
  - Examples:
    - Cloud applications
    - Mobile and gaming applications
    - Dynamic websites
    - Content distribution
    - Big data analytics
   
- S3 Intelligent-Tiering
  - Useful is your data is unknown or changing access patterns
  - Stores objects in 3 tiers
    - A frequent access tier
    - An infrequent access tier
    - An archive instant access tier
  - Amazon S3 monitors access patterns of your data and automaticlly moves your data to the most cost-effective storage tier based on frequenecy of access
 
- S3 Standard Infrequent Access (Standard-IA)
  - For data that is accessed less frequently but requires rapid access when needed
  - Offers:
    - High Durability
    - High Throughout
    - Low Latenecy of S3 standard
    - Low per-GiB storage Price
    - Low per-GiB retrieval fee
  - Ideal for:
    - Long-term backups
    - Disaster recovery files

- S3 One Zone Infrequent Access (One Zone-IA)
  - Stores data in a single AZ
  - Reduce costs compared to S3 Standard-IA, which uses 3 AZs
  - Suits customers seeking affordable storage for infrequently accessed data without high availability needs
  - Ideal for:
    - Store secondary backups
    - Store easily recreatable data

- S3 Express One Zone
  - Deliver consistent single-digit millisecond data access for your most frequently accessed data and latency-sensitive applications
  - Delivers data access speed up to 10x fatser and request costs up to 80% lower than S3 Standard
 
- S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
  - Offers low-cost storage for archived data that is accessed 1-2 times/year
  - Data can be accessed in as little as 1-5 minutes using an expedited retrieval
  - Request bulk retrievals in up to 5-12 hours at no additional cost
  - Ideal for:
    - Backup
    - Disaster recovery
    - Offsite data storage needs
    - When some data occasionally must be retrieved in minutes

- S3 Glacier Deep Archive
  - The lowest-cost Amazon S3 storage class
  - Supports long-term retention and digital preservation for data that might be accessed 1/2 times per year
  - Default retrieval time: 12 hours
  - Designed for customers that retain data sets for 7-10 years or longer, to meet regulatory compliance requirements
  - Examples:
    - Highly regulated industries: financial services, healthcare, public sectors
   
- S3 Outposts
  - Delivers object storage to your on-premises AWS Outposts environment using Amazon S3 APIs & features
  - Serves workloads with local data residency requirements
  - Helps maintain optimal performance when data must retain in close proximity to on-premises applications

#### 2. S3 Lifecycle
- Avoid manually managing own object storage tier configurations
- Use S3 LifeCycle to configurations to automate the process
- 2 Types of Actions
  - Transition actions: define when objects should transition to another storage class
  - Expiration actions: define when objects expire and should be permanently deleted
 
- Example
  - Transition objects to S3 Standard-IA storage class 30 days after you create them
  - Or archive objects to the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class 1 year after creating them

- Use Cases
  - Periodic Logs
    - If you upload periodic logs to a bucket, your application might need them for a week or month
    - After that, you might want to delete them
  - Data that changes in access frequency
    - Some documents are frequently accessed for a limited period of time
    - After that, they are infrequently accessed
    - At some point, you might not need real-time access to them
    - However, your organization or regulations might require you to archive them for a specific period
    - After that, you can delete them
