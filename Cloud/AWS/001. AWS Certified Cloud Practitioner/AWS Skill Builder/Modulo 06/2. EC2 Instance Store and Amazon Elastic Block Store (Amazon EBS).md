### 2. EC2 Instance Store and Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)

#### 1. AWS EC2 Instance Store
- NOT a stand-alone AWS block storage service
- It refers to the block-level that is physically attached to the EC2 instance host computer
- Depending on the type of instance, EC2 instance store might come attched as the default storage
- Since its data is lost when an instance is stopped/terminated, EC2 instance store is best for temporary memory-based storage needs, like buffers, caches, and scratch data
- NOT recommended for applications that require data retention

- Key takeway: NO Data Persistence
  - If you stop/terminate an Amazon EC2 instance, all the data written to the attched instance store is deleted
 
- Benefits
  - Automatically available storage
    - Instance store volumes come automatically attched to many EC2 instance types
    - Provide temporary block-level storage at no additional cost
    - Physically connected to the host computer
    - Offer high I/O performance for data that disapperas when the instance stops
  - Cost Effective
    - EC2 instance store is inlucded in the EC2 instance price
    - Potentially reduce expencses for applications that NOT require persistent storage
  - High Performance
    - Offers extremely low-latency storage directly attached to the host server of your EC2 instance
    - Exceptionally high I/O performance
    - Ideal for temporary storage of data requiring fast processing
   
#### 2. Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)
- Provides persistent block-level storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances
- EBS volumes act like external hard drives, offering consistent and low-latency performance for workloads like DBs and file systems
- EBS volumes can be conveniently backed up, resized, and attached to different EC2 instances
- Create: definte the configurations things like volume size and type
- After the volume has been created, it can be attached to an Amazon EC2 instance
- Becaure EBS volumes are for data that needs to be persist, important to back up the data
- It is recommended that you take incremental backups of EBS volumes by creating Amazon EBS snapshots

- Data Persistence
  - EBS provides block-level storage volumes that you can use with EC2 instances
  - Stop/Terminate a EC2 instance, all the data on the attched EBS volume remains available
 
- Use Cases
  - DB hosting
  - Backup storage for applications
  - Rapid deployment of development environments using volume snapshots
 
- Benefits
  - Data Migration
    - EBS volumes can be easily migrated between AZs using snapshots
    - The snapshots provide a simple way to move data across regions or create copies.
   
  - Instance Type Changes
    - Since EBS volumes remain independent of EC2 instances, not compliated to attach them to different instance types
    - This flexibility let your upgrade/downgrade instances without losing data
   
  - Disaster recovery
    - EBS snapshots provide reliable backup solutions that can be restored in different regions duing emergencies
    - Regular automated snapshots ensure your data remains protected and quickly recoverable
   
  - Cost Optimization
    - EBS volumes can be modified to different types and sizes to match actual usage patterns
    - You can switch between storage types or adjust capacity without downtime

  - Performance Tuning
    - EBS offers variours volume types to match different workload requirements and IOPS needs
    - You can adjust volume performance characteristics on the fly to meet changing application demands.
