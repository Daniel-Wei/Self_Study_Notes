### 2. EC2 Instance Store and Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)

#### 1. AWS EC2 Instance Store
- NOT a stand-alone AWS block storage service
- It refers to the block-level that is physically attached to the EC2 instance host computer
- Depending on the type of instance, EC2 instance store might come attched as the default storage
- Since its data is lost when an instance is stopped/terminated, EC2 instance store is best for temporary memory-based storage needs, like buffers, caches, and scratch data
- NOT recommended for applications that require data retention

- Key takeway: NO Data Persistence
  - If you stop/terminate an Amazon EC2 instance, all the data written to the attched instance store is deleted
 
- Benefits
  - Automatically available storage
    - Instance store volumes come automatically attched to many EC2 instance types
    - Provide temporary block-level storage at no additional cost
    - Physically connected to the host computer
    - Offer high I/O performance for data that disapperas when the instance stops
  - Cost Effective
    - EC2 instance store is inlucded in the EC2 instance price
    - Potentially reduce expencses for applications that NOT require persistent storage
  - High Performance
    - Offers extremely low-latency storage directly attached to the host server of your EC2 instance
    - Exceptionally high I/O performance
    - Ideal for temporary storage of data requiring fast processing
