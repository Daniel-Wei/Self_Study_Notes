### 1.2 Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) Data Lifecycle

#### 1. EBS Snapshots
- Point-in-time backups of EBS volume
- Usage
  - Disaster recovery
  - Data Migration
  - Volume resizing
  - Create consistent backups of production workloads
- Incremental, so they only save blocks on the volume that have changed after your most recent snapshots
- Can be used to create multiple new volumes
- New volumes created from a snapshot are an exact copy of the original volume at the time the snapshot was taken
- Snapshits of EBS volumes are stored redundantly in multiple AZs using Amazon S3

#### 2. Working with EBS snapshots
- In keeoing with the AWS shared responsibility model, as the customer, you are responsible for scheduling and managing regular EBS snapshots as part of your backup strategy
  - Monitor snapshot costs
  - Delete unnecessary snapshots to avoid excessive charges
  - Make sure sensitive data within snapshots is encrypted
  - Verify snapshot integrity
  - Test restoration procedures regularly

- Illustration
  - Initial Snapshot
    - A full copy of all the data on the volume at that point in time is included
    - Serves as the baseline and contains all the data blocks that were use on the volume

  - Subsequent Incremental Snapshots
    - Only the blocks that have changed since the last snapshot are captured and stored
    - Smaller and faster to create than the full snapshots
    - Contains references to the previous snapshots
    - Create a chain that allows for point-in-time recovery

  - Snapshot Consolidation and Management
    - Despite being incremental, each snapshot appears as a full point-in-time of your volume
    - The relationship between multiple snapshots of the same volume are managed automatically
    - When you delete a snapshot, only the data unique to that snapshot is removed
    - Data referenced by other snapshot is perserved

#### 3. Benefits
- Data Protection and Recovery
  - Snapshots enable fast data recovery from corruption, accidental deletion, or system failures using point-in-time backups

  - Operational Flexibility
    - Snapshots enable operations like cross-Region data migration, volume resizing, volume cloning, and sharing data across AWS accounts

  - Cost Effective
    - Snapshots use incremental backup technology, storing only changed blocks after the initial backup, reduing storage costs and backup time

#### 4. Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager
- By reduing manual effort and establishing consistent backup policies, Amazon Data Lifecycle Maneger helps maintain compliance requirements by scheduling regular backups and enforcing retention rules
- Steps
  - Create an EBS snapshots policy
    - using Amazon EC2 console, API calls, AWS CLI, SDKs, or AWS CloudFormation
  - Select target resource type
    - Choose either an EBS volume or an EC2 instance as the target for the snapshot
  - Exlude volumes
    - Narrow down the data to be included in the snapshot by choosing options to exclude either the root volume or data volumes
   - Set custom schedules
     - Automate the creation, retention, and deletion of EBS snapshots by setting up custome schedules
   - Apply additional actions
     - Before finalizing the policy, you can apply additional actions
     - These include configuring elements of the snapshots like tags, snapshot archiving, Amazon EBS fast snapshot restore, cross-Region copying, and cross-account sharing
