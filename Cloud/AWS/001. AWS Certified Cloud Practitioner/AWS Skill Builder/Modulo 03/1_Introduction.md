### Introduction to AWS Compute Options

#### 1. Unmanaged, Managed and Fully Managed Services
- Unmanaged Services
  - Example: Amazon EC2
  - AWS takes care of the underlying physical infrastructure
  - Users responsible for setting up, securing, and maintaining the OS, network configurations and applications on own instances

- Managed Services
  - reduce the amount of infrastructure users need to manage
  - AWS handles much of the operational overhead
  - Users might still need to perform some provisioning or config depending on the service

- Fully Managed Services
  - Example: Lambda
  - Eliminte the need to provision or managed any servers at all
  - The underlying infrastructure is fully managed by AWS
  - Users can entirely focus on writing and deploying code
 
#### 2. Conclusion
- Unmanaged: Configure OS, security patches, and network settings
- Managed: Choose deployment options and configure environment settings
- Fully Managed: Focus only on wrting and deploying code
