### Container and Orchestration on AWS

#### 1. Solve Deployment Challenges

##### 1.1 Containers and VMs
- Containers provide a reliable way to package applications' code and dependencies into a single, portable unit
- Make them ideal for workflows that require high security, reliability and scalablity
- A container packages application with everything it needs to run, so it works the same on any computer.
- Containers are faster and lighter than VMs as they share the host computer's OS
- VMs use a hypervisor to run full, separate OSs, which makes them less resource-efficient and have longer startup times.

##### 1.2 Deployment Consistency with Containers
- When developers' environment differ from staging or production, deployments can fail and become to debug.
- Containers solve this by keeping the application's environment consistent everywhere, making deployments smoother and assisting troubleshooting.

##### 1.3 Scaling Containers with Orchestration
- At large scale, manually handling container lifestyle, monitoring, and general operations becomes unsustainable.
- Orchestration automate deployment, scaling and management to keep everything running smoothly.

#### 2. AWS Container Services

##### 2.1 Amazon ECS
- Elasic Container Service
- Scalable container orchestration service for running and managing containers on AWS
- Launch Types
  - ECS with EC2
    - Ideal for small-to-medium businesses that need full control over infrastructure
    - Suitable for custom applications requiring specific hardware or networking configurations
    - Flexibility of EC2
    - Simplicity with ECS

  - ECS with AWS Fargate
    - Perfect for startups and small teams building web applications with variable traffic
    - Serverless option: no server management requires
    - Teams can focus on development
    - Amazon ECS handles scaling and orchestration

##### 2.2 Amazon EKS
- Elastic Kubernetes Service
- Fully manages service for running Kubernetes on AWS
- Simplify deploying, managing and scaling containerized applications, using open-source Kubernetes
- Launch Types
  - EKS with EC2
    - Best for enterprises needing full control over infrastructure
    - Offers deep customization of EC2 instances alongside Kubernetes scalability
    - Ideal for complex, large-scale workloads
   
  - EKS with AWS Fargate
    - Great for teams wanting Kubernetes flexibility without managing servers
    - Combines Kubernetes power with serverless simplicity
    - Help to scale applications quickly acroess various use cases
   
##### 2.3 Amazon ECR
- Elastic Container Registry
- Store, manage, and deploy container images
- Supports container images that follow Open Container Initiative (OCI) standards
- Push, pull and manage images in ECR repos using standard container tooling and CLIs (Command Line Interfaces)

##### 2.4 Fargate
- Serverless compute engine for containers
- Works with both ECS and EKS
- Container hosting platform
- No need to provision or manage servers: Fargate manage your server infrastructure
- Focus more on innovating and developing own applications
- Pay only for the resources that are required to run own containers

##### 2.5 Summary
- ECS: Scalable container orchestration service for running containers on AWS
- EKS: Fully managed Kubernetes service for deploying and scaling containers
- ECR: Stores, manages, and deploys OCI (Open Container Initiative)-compliant container images
- Fargate: Serverless compute engin for containers-removes the need to manage servers
