- Relocate
  - Change the hosting location to the cloud
  - If applications are already VMs or containers running on premises and then move to the cloud

- Rehost
  - Involves moving applications without changes
  - In a scenario of a large legacy migration, in which the company is looking to implement its migration and scale quickly to meet a business case, the majority of applications are rehosted

- Replatform
  - Involes making a few cloud optimizations to realize a tangible benefit
  - Optimization is achieved without changing the core architecture of the application

- Refactor
  - Involves reimagining how an application is acrchitectured and developed by using featires built for the cloud
  - Driven by a strong business need to add features, scale, or improve performance that would otherwise be difficuclt to achieve in the application's existing environment

- Repurchase
  - Involevs moving from a traditional license to a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model
  - Example: a business might choose to implement the repurchasing strategy by migrating form a customer relationship management (CRM) system to a new sales force software

- Retain
  - Consists of keeping applications that are critical for the business in the source environment
  - Include applications that require major refactoring before they can be migrated or work that can be postponed until a later time

- Retire
  - Process of removing applications that are no longer needed
