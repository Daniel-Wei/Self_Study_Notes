  - Secure communication between remote locations

#### 3. AWS PrivateLink: Securely connect resources, even in other VPCs
- Highly available, scaleable technology that clients can use to privately connect own VPC to services and resources as if they were in own VPC
- No need to use an internet gateway, NAT device, public IP address, Direct Connect connection, or AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection to allow communication with AWS services or resources from own private subnets
- Instead, clients control specific API endpoints, sites, services, and resources that are reachable from own VPC
- Benefits
  - Helps clients secure traffic and connect with simplified management rules
- Use Cases
  - Connect own users in own VPC to resources, other VPCs, and endpoints.

  - Increases amount of bandwidth

- Catagories
  - Latenecy-Sensitive Applications
