### 4. Subnets, Security Groups, and Network Access Control Lista

#### 1. Subnets
- Subnet: A section of a VPC in which you can group resources based on secutity or operational needs
- Public Subnets
  - Contain resources that need to be accessible by the public
  - Such as: an online store's website
- Private Subnets
  - Contain resources that should be accessible only through own private network
  - Such as: a DB that contains customers' personal information or order histories
- In a VPC, you can define rules to allow resources in different subnets to communicate with each other
  - Example: You might have an application that uses Amazon EC2 instances in a public subnet communicating with DBs that are located in a private subnet

#### 2. Network Traffic in a VPC

- When a customer requests data from an application hosted in the AWS Cloud, this request is sent as a packet
- A packet is a unit of data sent over the internet or a network

- It enters into a VPC through an internet gateway
- Before a packet can enter into a subnet or exit from a subnet, it will run into several cecks for permissions

- One being a network ACL associated with the subnet the packet is being routed to
- The permissions defined by the network ACLs indicate what is allowed or denied
- It is based on who sent the paket and how the packet is trying to communicate with the resources in a subnet

#### 3. Network ACLs: Virtual Firewall Controlling Traffic
- A network ACL is a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic at subnet level

- Each AWS account includes a default network ACL
- When conguring own VPC, you can use your own account's default network ACL, or create custom network ACLs.
- By default, own account's default ACL allows all inbound & outbound traffic

- Custom network ACLs
  - All inbound & outbound traffic is denied until you add rules to specify which traffic to allow
  - Additionally, all network ACLs have an explicit deny rule
  - This rule makes sure that if a packet does not match any of the other rules on the list, the packet is denied

- Stateless Packet Filtering

  - Remember nothing and check packets that cross the subnet border each way every time: inbound & outboud

#### 4. Security Groups
- Control inbound & outbound traffic at the resource level

- After a packet has entered a subnet, it must have its permission evaluated for resources within the subnet, such as EC2 instances
- A security group is the VPC component that checks packet permissions for an Amazon EC2 instance
- It is a virtual firewall that controls inbound & outbound traffic for specific AWS resources, like EC2 instances

- By default, a security group denies all inbound traffic and allows all outbound traffic

- Security Groups with Custom rules

- Note: if you have multiple Amazon EC2 instances within the same VPC, you can associate them with the same security group or use different security groups for each instance

- Stateful Packet Filtering
  - Remember previous decisions made for incoming packets

### 5. Network ACLs and Security Groups
| Feature              | Security Groups | Network ACLs |
| :---------------- | :------: | ----: |
| Scope        |   Instance Level (attached to EC2 instances)   |  Subnet Level (associated with subnets)  |
| State           |   Stateful (remembers state)   |  Stateless (doesn't remember state)  |
| Rule Types    |  Only allow type rules   |  Both allow and deny type rules  |
| Return Traffic |  Return traffic is automatically allowed if inbound traffic is allowed   |  Return traffic must be implicitly allowed in both directions  |
| Use Cases |  Fine-grained control of traffic for individual EC2 instances   |  Broad control of traffic in and out of subnets  |
