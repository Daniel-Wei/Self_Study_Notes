### 4. Subnets, Security Groups, and Network Access Control Lista

#### 1. Subnets
- Subnet: A section of a VPC in which you can group resources based on secutity or operational needs
- Public Subnets
  - Contain resources that need to be accessible by the public
  - Such as: an online store's website
- Private Subnets
  - Contain resources that should be accessible only through own private network
  - Such as: a DB that contains customers' personal information or order histories
- In a VPC, you can define rules to allow resources in different subnets to communicate with each other
  - Example: You might have an application that uses Amazon EC2 instances in a public subnet communicating with DBs that are located in a private subnet

#### 2. Network Traffic in a VPC

- When a customer requests data from an application hosted in the AWS Cloud, this request is sent as a packet
- A packet is a unit of data sent over the internet or a network

- It enters into a VPC through an internet gateway
- Before a packet can enter into a subnet or exit from a subnet, it will run into several cecks for permissions

- One being a network ACL associated with the subnet the packet is being routed to
- The permissions defined by the network ACLs indicate what is allowed or denied
- It is based on who sent the paket and how the packet is trying to communicate with the resources in a subnet

#### 3. Network ACLs: Virtual Firewall Controlling Traffic
- A network ACL is a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic at subnet level
- Each AWS account includes a default network ACL
- When conguring own VPC, you can use your own account's default network ACL, or create custom network ACLs.
- By default, own account's default ACL allows all inbound & outbound traffic
