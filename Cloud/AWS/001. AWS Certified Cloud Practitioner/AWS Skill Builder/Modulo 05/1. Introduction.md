### 1. Introduction to Networking

#### 1. Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)
- An Amazon VPC lets clients provision logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud
- Where clients can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that they define

#### 2. Subnet
- A Subsection of a VPN
- Subnets are used to organize own resources and can be made publicly or privately accessible
- A private subnet is commonly used to contain resources like a DB storing cutomer or transactional information.
- A public subnet is commonly used for resources like a customer-facing website.

#### 3. Networking Components: Understanding connections through diagrams

- Diagram Basics 1
  - The AWS Cloud is the outermost box in most diagrams

  - Region: Next box
    - AWS Region are separate geographic areas
    - Clients can choose Region based on their users' geographic location for lower latency, compliance and data residency requirements, avaialble services and costs

  - Amazon VPC: Solid box
    - It represents clients' isolated, logically segmented network within AWS
    - A VPC helps clients to control own network resources and security

  - Availability Zones (AZs)
    - Separate boxes across a Region
    - AZs consist of 1/more discrete data centers
    - Each data center with redundant power, networking and connectvity, and housed in separate facilities.
    - Using multiple AZs can protect own applications from the failure of a single location in the Region.

- Diagram Basics 2
  - Subnets
    - Essentially segements of own VPC
    - Allow clients to divide own VPC into smaller, manageable sections
    - A subnet is a range of IP addressed in own VPC
   
  - Private Subnets
    - Designed to isolate resources that should NOT be directly exposed to the public internet

- Diagram Basics 3
  - Public Subnets
    - Designed to provide direct internet access to resources placed inside them
    - To allow access, they are connected with an internet gateway
