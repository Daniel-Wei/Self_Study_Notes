### 6. Global Neworking: Edge Networking Services

#### 1. Secure and speedy networking for user-facing application data
- Edge networking is the process of bringing information storage and computing abilities closer to the devices that produce that information and the users who consume it
- Edge computing is important because organizations often need lower latency access to their data and content
- By performing tasks or caching data locally or closer to users, organizations can deliver faste, more responsive experiences, while maintaining better control over their infrastructure

#### 2. Translating domain names to IP addressed with DNS
- DNS resolution involves a customer DNS resolver communicating with a company DNS server
- Steps
  - Customer & Laptop: when you enter the domain name into your browser, this request is sent to a customer DNS resolver
  - Customer DNS Resolver: asks the company DNS server for the IP addressed that correspond to the company's website
  - The company DNS server responds by providing the IP address for company's website
