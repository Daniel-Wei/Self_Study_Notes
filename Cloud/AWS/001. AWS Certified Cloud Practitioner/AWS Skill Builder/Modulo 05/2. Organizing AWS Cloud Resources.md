### 2. Organizing AWS Cloud Resources

#### 1. Establish boundaries around AWS resources
- Amazon VPC
  - With Amazon VPC, clients can provision an isolated section of the AWS Cloud
  - In this isolated section, clients can launch resources in a virtual network that they define
  - 3 main benefits
    - Increase security & Control environment
      - Clients can secure and monitor connections, screen traffic, and restrict instance access
    - Save Time
      - Spend less time setting up, managing, and validating own virtual network when compared to on-premised network management

  - Subnets
    - Within an Amazon VPC, clients can organize own resources into subsections or subnets
    - A subnet is a section of an Amazon VPC that can contain resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances
   
#### 2. Internet Gateway

- To allow public traffic from the internet to access own VPC, clients attach an internet gateway to the VPC
- An internet gateway is a connection between a VPC and the internet
- Without an internet gateway, no one can access the resources within the VPC

#### 3. Virtual Private Gateways (VPN)

- VPN creates a connection that is more like a secure tunnel through the internet
- Using encryption, it hides and protects everything you send and receive from outside eyes
- A virtual private gateway is the component in the AWS Cloud that makes it possible for you to connect this protected traffic to enter the VPC
- With a VPN connection, your data travels privately and safely, hidden from others using the same route
- With a VPN, you can establish a VPN connection between your PC and a private network, such an on-premises data center or internal corporate network.
- A VPN allows traffic into the VPC only if it is coming from an approved network.

#### 4. Summary
- VPC
  - Virtual Private Cloud
  - Used to establish boundaries around own AWS resource

   - Virtual Private Gateway
   - Allows protected internet traffic to enter into the VPC
  
  - VPC Connection
    - Virtual Private Gateway Connection
    - A VPN encrypts your internet traffic
    - protect it from anyone who might try to intercept or monitor it
