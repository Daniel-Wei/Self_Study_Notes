### 1. Prevent Unauthorized Access.md

#### 1. IAM: AWS Identity and Access Management
- The principle of least privilege dictates that you should only give people and systems access to what they need and nothing else
- AWS account root user
  - Has the permission to do anything inside the AWS account
  - To handle daily tasks, should create other IAM identities, such as IAM users
- IAM Users
  - Represents a person/application that interacts with AWS services and resources
  - Recommend creating individual IAM users for each person, so have own unique set of security credentials
- IAM Groups
  - Collection of IAM users
  - All users inherit the permissions assigned to the group
- IAM Roles
  - An identity you can assume to gain temporary access to permissions
  - Example: barista in the morning and cashier in the afternoon
  - When someone assumes an IAM role, they abandon all previous permissions they had under previous role and assume the permissions of the new role
- IAM Policies
  - JSON document that allows or denies permission to access AWS services/resources
  - Can also define the level of access to resources
 
#### 2. Additional Access Management Services
- AWS IAM Identity Center
  - Centralizes identity and access management across accounts and applications
  - Can also connect to an existing identity source and provide your workforce with SSO access to all your connected AWS services and accounts
  - Federated(联邦的) Identity Management: a system allows users to access multiple applications, services, or domains using a single set of credentials
- AWS Secrets Manager
  - Provides a secure way to manage, rotate, and retrieve database credentials, API keys, and other secrets throughout their lifecycle
- AWS Systems Manager
  - Provides a centralized view of nodes across your org's accounts and Regions and multi-cloud environments
  - Can quickly access node information, such as ID and operating system details, and automate registry edits, user management, and security patching
