### 3. Protect Data.md

#### 1. Types of Data Encryption
- Data Encryption at Rest
  - Data is idle and not moving
- Data Encryption in Transit
  - Data is moving between locations
  - SSL/TSL certificates are used to establish encrypted network connections from one system to another

#### 2. AWS Data Encryption
- AWS Built-in Data Encryption
  - S3
    - By default, all new S3 buckets have encryption configured
    - All uploaded objects are encrypted at rest
  - EBS
    - EBS volumes and snapshots can be encrypted at rest
    - Include bothe boot and data volumes of an Amazon EC2 instance
  - DynamoDB
    - Server-side encryption at rest is enabled on all DynamoDB table data
    - Use encryption keys stored in AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)
   
- AWS Data Protection Services
  - AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)
    - Create & manage cryprographic keys
    - Keys never leave KMS
    - Tempotarily disable them so they can no longer be used
    - Ctyptographic Key: a random string of digits used for locking & unlocking data
  - Amazon Macie
    - Monitor your sensitive data at rest to make sure it is safe
    - Uses ML and automation to discover sensitive data stored in S3
    - Can be used to access your security posture, which is especially helpful for meeting compliance requirements
  - AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)
    - Centralizes the management of your SSL/TLS certificates that provide data encryption in transit
    - It can be used to protect various AWS services and your connected on-premised resources
