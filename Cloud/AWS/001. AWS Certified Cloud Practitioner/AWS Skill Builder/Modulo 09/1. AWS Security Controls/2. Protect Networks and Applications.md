  - An attacker floods a web application with excessive network traffic
  - Legitmate customer requests are denied if the web application becomes overloaded and can no longer respond
- DDoS attacks: Distributed Denial of Service

  - An attacked can use multiple infected computers (zombie bots) to unknowingly send excessibe traffic to a web application
 
#### 2. AWS Network and Application Protection
- AWS Protection through Infrastructure
  - Security Groups
    - Only allow in proper request traffic
    - Operates at the AWS network level
    - Shrug off massive attacks using the entire AWS Region's capacity
  - Elastic Laod Balancing (ELB)
    - Handles traffic first before handing it off
    - Your frontend server is not overwhelmed
    - Runs at Region level
  - Regions
    - Enormous capacity of Regions makes them extremely difficuclt to overwhelm

- AWS Protection through Services
  - AWS Shield
    - Shield Standard
      - No cost
      - Designed to automatically protect AWS customers from the most common, frequently occurring types of DDoS attacks
     - Shield Advanced
       - Paid Service
       - Provides detailed attach diagnostics and the ability to detect and mitigate sophisticated DDoS attacks
     - Additionally, you can integrate AWS Shield with AWS WAF by writing custome rules to mitigate complex DDoS attacks

  - AWS WAF
    - Web application firewall
    - Monitors network requests that come into your web application
    - When a request comes into WAF, it checks the IP address against a web access control list (web ACL)
