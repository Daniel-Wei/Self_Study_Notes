- EC2 Instance
  - Rightsize your resources
  - Analyze and adjust your resources to meet the needs of your workload
  - Sevices such as AWS Compute Optimizer can help
  - Spot Instances
    - Work well for workloads that are tolerant to interruptions
    - Use spare EC2 capacity for a significant discount compared to On-Demand instances

- Auto Scaling
  - When demand drops, AWS Auto Scaling will automatically remove any excess resource capacity, to avoid overspending
  - Application load balancing also helps distribute traffic across EC2 instances

- Amazon RDS: Amazon Relational Database Service
  - Scale storage using storage autoscaling which prevents over/under-provisioning
  - Read replicas scale capacity horizontally, meaning your resources will not need to a scale up into a larger instance
  - Instead of scaling the primary instances, read replicas are used to store data and can be used for heavy workloads which in turn reduces the strain on the primary instance
  - Similarly, using smth like Amazon Elasticache for caching also reduce the load on your primary instance and optimize for cost
 
- Amazon S3
  - Using the righ storage class is the key to optimize cost in the cloud
  - Example:
    - S3 Glacier Deep Archive as a low-cost storage tier ideal for data is accessed 1/2 time a yr
    - S3 Intelligent-Tiering for data with unknown/changing access patterns
  - VPC endpoints to help optimize for cost as well
    - Help recude data transfer costs for S3 accesse
