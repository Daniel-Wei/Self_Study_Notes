### Diving Deeper into AWS Global Infrastructure

#### 1. Deploy multi-Region and multi-AZ resources
- By building redundant architectures or replicating own resources across multiple levels of AWS infrastructure, clients can improve application reliability so that their users have access to their content when they need it

- High Availability
  - Capability of a system to operate continuously without failing
  - Applications can handle the failure of individual components without significant downtime

- Agility
  - Ability to quickly adapt to changing requirements or market conditions
  - With AWS infrastructure in place, clients can modify and deploy services rapidly
 
- Elasticity
  - Ability of system to scale resources up/down automatically in response to changes in demand
  - AWS infrastructure is set up for you to scale resources up/down on demand
 
#### 2. Edge locations
- Provides quicker content access to users outside of standard Regions
- Offer multiple services to run closer to end users, inc. AWS networking services like Amazon CloudFront.

#### 3. Key elements of AWS Global Infrastructure
- Regions
  - Geographical areas around the world that are made up of multiple data centers
  - There data centers provide scalable and redundant infrastructure for hosting cloud services
  - Each Region consists of multiple, isolated locations-Availability Zones(3 or more)

- Availability Zones (AZs)
  - Distinct locations within a Region
  - Each designed as an independent zone with its own power, networking and connectivity
  - AZ maintain high availability and fault tolerance for applications
  - Each AZ consists of 1 or more data centers
 
- Edge Locations
  - Strategically places sites around the world that cache content to deliver data, video and applications
  - With lower latency and higher transfer speeds
  - Vital part of the AWS content delivery network (CDN) and user services like CloudFront to efficientky distribute data to end users.
