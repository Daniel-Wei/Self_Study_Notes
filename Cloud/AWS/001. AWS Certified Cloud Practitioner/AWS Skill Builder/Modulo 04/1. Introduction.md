#### 1. AWS edge locations
-  Coffee shop could expand with smaller versions of the shop such as mobile coffee carts
-  Edge locations cache items like images, and other resources, so that users can access the content they need with lower latency

#### 2. Infrastructure as code and CloudFormation
- Coffee shop: expansion would be to maintain a consistent product from location to location
- CloudFormation: help automaye the deployment of own cloud resources
- Services use infrastructure as code/IaC, help users achieve a consistent, reliable set up each time own business grows.
