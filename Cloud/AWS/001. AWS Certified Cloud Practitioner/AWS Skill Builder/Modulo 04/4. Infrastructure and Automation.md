### Infrastructure and Automation

#### 1.CloudFormation
- Help user model and set up own AWS resources so that they can spend less time managing those resources and more time focusing on own applications run in AWS
- With CloudFormation, users can define own infrastructure as code
- Users can create a template that describes all the AWS resources that they want (like Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances)
- CloudFormation takes care of provisioning and configuring resources for users

#### 2. Interacting with AWS resources
- Programmatic Access
  - AWS CLI
    - Automate rourine tasks
    - Example: script to provide routine backups for a service such as Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)
  - SDKs
    - Invoke APIs for one part of an application process
    - Example: use an SDK to store user data in an AWS storage service such an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)

- AWS Management Console
  - Billing and cost optimization dashboards and visualizations
  - Services focused on graphical representations, like Amazon QuickSight and Amazon Neptune

- Infrastructure as Code
  - With IaC tools such as Cloudformation, users can automate resource management across own organization with AWS service integrations
  - Offer efficient and repeatable resource creation and management
  - Examples
    - Managing infrastructure with DevOps such as continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines
    - Scaling resources such as Amazon EC2 instances to multi-Region applications in a consistent, repeatable way
