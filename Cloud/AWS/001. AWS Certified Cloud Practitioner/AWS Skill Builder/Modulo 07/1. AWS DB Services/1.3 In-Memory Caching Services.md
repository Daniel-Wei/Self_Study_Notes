### 1.3 In-Memory Caching Services.md

#### 1. Amazon ElastiCache
- Fully managed in-memory cachung service
- Help reduce the complexity of administering in-memory caching systems
- You can continue user the same Redis, Valkey, or Memcached tools and configurations to scale your workloads
- It automatically detects and replaced failed nodes
- Ideal for applications that need consistent high performance

- Use Cases
  - Session Data Management
  - DB Query Enhancement
  - Gaming Leaderboards
 
  - Benefits
    - High Performance for Redis, Valkey, or Memecached instances
      - Streamlines the deployment and maintenance of in-memory caching environments
      - Offers high availability for Redis, Valkey, and Memcached by automatically handling hardware provisioning, software patching, and monitoring
      - Offers seamless scalability so you can add/remove nodes as demand changes

    - High Availability
      - Constantly monitor primary nodes for potential failures
      - When issues are detected, it maintains application availability while promoting a replica node to become the new primary without manual intervention
      - The entire recovery process typically within minutes, which minimizes downtime and preservces operations during infrastructure disruptions
     
    - Replication across Multiple AZs
      - Protect against infrastructure failures
      - You can configure primary and replica nodes across different AZs according to their durability requirements

    - Data Encryption
      - Supports data encryption mechanisms to safeguard sensitive information throughout its lifecycle
      - At-rest data encryption protects data while stored in disk storage and automated backups
      - In-transit encryption secures data traveling between clients and cache nodes by employing transport layer security, or TLS, for encrypted connections
