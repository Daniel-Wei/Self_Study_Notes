### 1.1 Relational DB Services

#### 1. Introduction
- Definition
  - Stores data in a way that relates it to other pieces of data
  - They use structured query language, or SQL, to manage and query data
- AWS offers fully managed relational DB solutions that remove the burden of DB administration while maintaining high avaiability and security
- Example: Inventory management system for a restaurant

#### 2. Amazon Relational DB Service (Amazon RDS)
- Managed
- Supports different DB engines

- Use Cases
  - Web applications
  - Enterprise workloads
  - Product inventories for e-commerce platforms

- Benefits
  - Cost Optimization
    - Eliminates the high upfront cost of purchasing and maintaining DB hardware infrastructure
    - Only pay for the compute and storage resources that you consume
    - As a managed service, also reduces operational expenses by automating time-consuming administrative tasks like backups, patching and monitoring
   
   - Multi-AZ Deployment
     - Improves DB reliability
     - Automatiaclly replicates data to a standby instance in a different AZ
     - During system failures, maintenence, or zone disruptions, RDS automatically fails over to the standby instance without manual intervention
     - Ensures continuous DB operations with minimal downtime

  - Performance Optimization
    - Through automated management of resource allocation, monitoring, and optimization tasks
    - Includes features like automated backups, and read replicas that can help offload read trafiic from the primary instance
    - RDS Performance Insights provide real-time monitoring and analysis of DB load, to help you identify and resolve performance bottlenecks quickly
   
  - Security Controls
    - Through multiple layers of protection
    - Includes VPC isolation, encryption at rest and in transit
    - Leverages automated backups and offers Multi-AZ deployments to provide resiliency against potential system failures
   
#### 3. Amazon Aurora
- Managed
- Designed to help reduce unnecessary I/O operations
- Compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL
- Provides high performance and availability
- Automatically scales alongside your workloads
- Replicates data acroess multiple AZs for enhanced durability and fault tolerance
- Features automated backups, encryption at rest, and continuous monitoring

- Use Cases
  - Gaming Applications
  - Media and content management
  - Real-time analytics
 
- Benefits
  - High performance and availability
    - Up to 5 time the throughout of standard MySQL and 3 times the throughput of PostgreSQL
    - Uses a distributed storage system across multiple nodes
   
  - Automated storage and backup management
    - Automatically grows storage, eliminates guesswork in capacity
    - Continuously back up your DB to Amazon S3 to provide point-in-time recovery

  - Advanced replication and fault tolerance
    - Replicates data acroess 3 AZs with 6 copies of data
    - Automatically detects DB failures and redirects traffic to healthy replicas without data loss
