### React 17: Getting Started

#### 1. The Basics
  
  - **Why React**
    - Definition: A JS Library for building user interfaces
    - Since web browsers understand JS, we can use React to describe web user interfaces
    - **React is "declarative"**: We just tell React what we want, and it will build the actual user interfaces on our behalf in the web browser.
    - HTML and React
      - HTML: Declarative for Static Content
      - React; Declarative for Dynamic Data
    - Disadvantages of Frameworks
      - Limited Flexibility: Do things in a certain way; Hard to deviate
      - Larege and Full of features: Hard to customize; Use the whole thing
     
    - Advantages of React
      - Gives devs the ability to work with a 'virtual' browser that is friendlier than the real browser (DOM API)
      - 'Just JavaScript'
      - React Native (for the win): Learning React pays off big time for iOS and Android mobile applications as well
      - Battle-tested: deved and tested by FB
      - **Declarative Language** (Model UI and State)
        - Established a new language between developers and browsers that allowed developers to declaratively describe stateful user interfaces.
        - Instead of coming up with steps for the transactions on their interfaces, developers just describe the interfaces in terms of a final state, like a function
        - When transactions happen to that state, React takes care of updating the user interfaces based on that.
